#+title: Homestead replacement

This is a Compose file that runs a set of containers to act as a Docker based
replacement to the Laravel/Homestead image.

* How to use
In ~start.sh~, change the ~PHP_PROJECT~ environment variable to the path to your
project. For example:
#+begin_example
PHP_PROJECT=student_administration
#+end_example
When you want to start the containers, run the ~start.sh~ script. In the
beginning, it will error with "connection refused". To fix this, run this
command:
#+begin_src
./bin/php artisan migrate:fresh
#+end_src
