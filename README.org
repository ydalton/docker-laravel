#+title: Homestead replacement
This is a Compose file that runs a set of containers to act as a Docker based
replacement to the Laravel/Homestead image.

* How to use
In ~env~, change the ~PHP_PROJECT~ environment variable to the path to your
project. For example:
#+begin_example
PHP_PROJECT=student_administration
#+end_example
When you want to start the containers, run the ~start.sh~ script. In the
beginning, it will error with "connection refused". To fix this, run this
command:
#+begin_src
./bin/php artisan migrate:fresh
#+end_src
* Project configuration
You will need to modify the .env file in the root of the project in order for
it to work. The required changes are:
- ~DB_USERNAME~ should be "root"
- ~DB_PASSWORD~ should be "secret"
- ~DB_HOST~ should be "mysql"
Do NOT change anything in ~docker-compose.yml~, you might break something!
